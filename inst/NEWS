+ Added Chao1 index in richness function
+ In atlas1006 data set, pseudocount of +1 in otu table has been
  removed to facilitate comparison with sequencing data sets and to
  avoid confusion

  combination is chosen (at random)
+ New function collapse_replicates has been added
+ Abundance matrices (otu tables) for all example data sets now
  starting from 0 without pseudocount
