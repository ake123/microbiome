    HITChipDB

  o polished estimate.diversity function

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.15 (2012-08-31)
  o FetchHITChipAtlas and run.profiling.script validated against each other
  o default imputation removed from run.profiling.script; this had considerable effect on normalized data

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.04 (2012-06-15)
  o RMySQL removed from explicit dependencies

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.03 (2012-06-06)

  o hitchip.phylodistance added

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.02 (2012-06-03)

  o annotation functions added

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.01 (2012-05-31)

  o removed absolute scale matrices from run.profiling.script
    output. The idea is that just one log10 file for each phylogenetic
    level is outputted, and the user can then use other reading/analysis
    routines to read the data, convert to original non-log domain if
    necessary, etc. This is to provide a unique output format to avoid mistakes.
  o save.data and tree.display removed from run.profiling.script arguments
  o combined get.phylogeny and get.phylogeny.MITChip
  o moved plotting functions from run.profiling.script into a separate
    function profiling.hclust; 
  o removed the option to read profiling parameters from R file in ReadParameters function
  o output file name phylogenyinfo.tab changed into phylogenyinfo-nspecies.tab 
  o made run.profiling.script modular with respect to preprocessing, plotting, data storage, and logging
  o added instructions in the vignette on reading the final data

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12.14 (2012-05-10)

  o added pitchipdb in PITChip array name list in profiling.R

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12.12 (2012-05-02)

  o added MITChip level 0
  o added separate get.phylogeny.MITChip function to include level 0 for MITChip

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12.10 (2012-04-17)

  o automatized the levels and methods output within run.profiling.script
  o now providing also non-logarithmized data matrices in the run.profiling.script output
  o added in run.profiling.script save.image(paste(params$wdir,
    "/tmp.RData", sep = "")) to enable the use of data from the current
    workspace during a session
  o multcomp replaced by parallel in dependencies
  o Removed "Use existing data from the workspace" (useDB) option. Problems when called from within a function. More clear and modular when
    the run.profiling.script is used for preprocessing, and any new plots are performed as separate steps based on the profiling output files if needed.
  o Moved run.profiling.script plots to their own functions and added usage examples to vignette.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12.08 (2012-04-05)

  o detailed protocol added to the vignette 
  o hierarchical clustering method moved from complete to ward in profiling script

  o 'level 0' added in MITChip profiling
  o removed featureprofile from output files to save disk space, typically not needed
  o added remove.nonspecific.oligos option to run.profiling.script and FetchHITChipAtlas functions (through get.phylogeny)
  o summarize.probesets modified to include levels both in the form of "level.1" and "level 1"

  o fixed PITChip-specific issues
  o removed parallel from dependencies to allow compatibility with R-2.12.2

  o removed minmax, quantnorm from profiling.R functions
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12.04 (2012-03-28)

  o removed the additional background correction step which resulted in
    considerable information loss based on external validations
