\title{Rarity Index}
\usage{
rarity(x, index = "all", detection = 0.2/100, prevalence = 20/100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object}

\item{index}{If the index is given, it will override the other parameters.
See the details below for description and references of the standard
rarity indices.}

\item{detection}{Detection threshold for absence/presence
(strictly greater by default).}

\item{prevalence}{Prevalence threshold (in [0, 1];
strictly greater by default)}
}
\value{
A vector of rarity indices
}
\description{
Calculates the community rarity index.
}
\details{
The rarity index characterizes the concentration of species at
low abundance.

The following rarity indices are provided:
\itemize{
\item{log_modulo_skewness }{Quantifies the concentration of the least
abundant species by the log-modulo skewness of the arithmetic
abundance classes (see Magurran & McGill 2011). These are typically
right-skewed; to avoid taking log of occasional negative skews,
we follow Locey & Lennon (2016) and use the log-modulo
transformation that adds a value of one to each measure of skewness
to allow logarithmization. The values q=0.5 and n=50 are used here.}
\item{low_abundance }{Relative proportion of the least abundant species,
below the detection level of 0.2\%. The least abundant species are
determined separately for each sample regardless of their prevalence.}
\item{noncore_abundance }{Relative proportion of the non-core species,
exceed the detection level of 0.2\% at 50\% prevalence at most.
This is complement of the core with the same thresholds.}
\item{rare_abundance }{Relative proportion of the rare 
taxa in [0,1] - the rare taxa are detected with less than 20\%
prevalence, regardless of abundance.}
}
