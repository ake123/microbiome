\usage{
aggregate_taxa(x, level, top = NULL, fill_na_taxa = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object}

\item{level}{Summarization level (from \code{rank_names(pseq)})}

\item{top}{Keep the top-n taxa, and merge the rest under the category
'Other'. Instead of top-n numeric this can also be a character vector
listing the groups to combine.}

\item{fill_na_taxa}{If TRUE, the NA entries in tax_table(x) will be replaced by "Unknown"}
}
\value{
Summarized phyloseq object
}
\description{
Summarize phyloseq data into a higher phylogenetic level.
}
\details{
This provides a convenient way to aggregate phyloseq OTUs
(or other taxa) when the phylogenetic tree is missing. Calculates the
sum of OTU abundances over all OTUs that map to the same higher-level
group. Removes ambiguous levels from the taxonomy table. Returns a
phyloseq object with the summarized abundances.
